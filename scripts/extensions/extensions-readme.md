# About Extensions

I'd like to periodically make extensions for these systems based on requests I see (whether those requests are actually for my systems or not--if I can jam it in I will).  These extensions will feature additional options, macros, and functions that, while helpful, are espensive / specific enough to warrant not being a part of the generic release.  I.E. these features usually have some drawbacks.

If you have any ideas for extensions, catch up with me on Reddit (u/ChapelR), or open an issue and make a feature request here.

# Simple Inventory Extensions

Refer to the docusmentation for the simple inventory system in the main `readme.md` file for more infromation on this system.
